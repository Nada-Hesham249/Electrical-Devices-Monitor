# Electrical-Devices-Monitor
This project is developed to enhance home safety and promote energy awareness by monitoring the runtime of household electrical devices.

## Key Features:
- **Real-time device usage tracking**  
  Continuously monitors how long each electrical device is running in real-time.

- **Overuse detection with alarms**  
  If a device exceeds its safe operating time (e.g., an iron), the system triggers an alarm to prevent overheating or fire.

- **Energy consumption logging**  
  Records device usage durations to help users analyze and reduce electricity waste.
