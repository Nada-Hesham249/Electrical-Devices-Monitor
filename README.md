# Electrical-Devices-Monitor
This project is developed to enhance home safety and promote energy awareness by monitoring the runtime of household electrical devices.

## Key Features:
- **Real-time device usage tracking
Continuously monitors how long each electrical device has been operating.

- **Overuse Detection & Alerts
If a device runs beyond its safe operating time (e.g., an iron or space heater), the system automatically triggers an alarm to prevent potential hazards like overheating or fire.

- **Usage Logging & Insights
Logs the usage duration of each device, allowing users to review their electricity consumption and better understand their energy usage patterns.
